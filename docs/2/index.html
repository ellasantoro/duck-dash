                    <h2>Game Layout</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The game follows two enemies: a duck (controlled by the user) and a dog in the neighborhood
                        </li>
                        <li>The duck loves shiny things and likes to steal all the coins that humans have dropped!</li>
                        <li>The duck is able to jump onto crates to escape the dog - but only if the crates are high
                            enough! Coins may
                            also land on top of crates.</li>
                        <li>Falling off of the platform will result in a decremented score, but gaining a coin will
                            result in an incremented score.</li>
                        <li>If the dog is coming a little too close, the duck can push the dog back a few steps by
                            clicking on it.</li>
                        <li>If the dog catches up, the duck will die, and you will be presented with the option to play
                            again!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Game Details & Functionality</h2>
                    <p>This game was created using THREE.js and borrows Professor Michael Gleicher's CS559 Framework provided in UW-Madison's Computer Graphics Course.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Game mechanics and user (key and click) input in 3D using THREE.js</li>
                        <li>Keeping score in game by combining game mechanics in 3D with score tracking, as well as
                            connecting HTML to JS to update score</li>
                        <li>Continuous game: game can be replayed an infinite number of times by clicking the respawn
                            button, which clears score, returns camera position, returns sprite positions, and clears
                            coin positions</li>
                        <li>Using imported models to create animation - accessing nodes of a model to make the
                            (dog,duck) models appear as though they are running by rotating leg nodes that were
                            extracted from a GLTF file</li>
                        <li>Creating leg animation only when the user is moving the duck</li>
                        <li>Creating movement functionality so that the duck cannot jump higher than a specific amount,
                            which is based on whether or not they are on the ground or on a crate, ensuring that the
                            duck can not just run on a grid, but can run diagonally as well</li>
                        <li>Handling collisions between duck and dog, and duck and box so that the duck can actually
                            jump on top of the box and not intersect it</li>
                        <li>Creating an ending "screen" to siginify the game has ended with a recap of score</li>
                        <li>Advanced 3D Shader to simulate a pond</li>
                        <li>Making the dog's position and rotation angle relative to where the user moves the duck, this
                            way the dog is not just facing one direction the entire time</li>
                        <li>Texture mapping, object creation, using vertices for building roofs, other demonstrated
                            concepts from class.</li>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
