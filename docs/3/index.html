                        <p>I have learned a lot in my extra project. Some things I set out to learn, and others I
                            learned through issues I encountered, or trying to better my game in general. Below is a
                            list of takeaways from my project</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to animate models using nodes from GLTF file</li>
                            <li>How to animate object parts based on user key input</li>
                            <li>How to move/other functionality based on user key input</li>
                            <li>How to rotate using quaternions; learning about quaternions in general, and why they
                                differ and can be advantageous in comparison to euler angles</li>
                            <li>How to use raycasters and personally defined event functions to create clicking events
                                based on where you click on the screen, and have 3D objects react to your clicking
                                action</li>
                            <li>How to set boundaries using boxes to ensure certain boxes won't intersect</li>
                            <li>How to make sprites fall off of a platform</li>
                            <li>How to make sprites jump, and be disallowed from double jumping, and changing a max jump
                                height based on where the y position is</li>
                            <li>Learned how important flags were (at least for me) when I was making my game!!! I needed
                                so many to satisfy all the things I wanted</li>
                            <li>Learned a lot about how many things are connected when you're creating a game and how
                                each part is so dependent on many other parts (or functions/flags), and how complex that
                                can get,
                                there are so many things I would've done differently in the process of making the game,
                                it got very messy, very fast.
                            </li>
                            <li>Connecting HTML and JS for score keeping and death screen ; different from how we've
                                used the connecting variables in the past.</li>
                            <li>using timers to randomly make objects appear (my coins!) and how to make the coins
                                disappear once collided</li>
                            <li>And lastly, re-learned some HTML tags in order to write these (not-so-)little blurbs.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 id="bump-maps-and-normal-maps">Rubric, Explanation, & Note from Student</h2>
                        <p>Looking back at my rubric, it is kind of odd with the buffergeometry and shader requirement,
                            as it isn't necessarily super relevant other than demonstrating what we've learned at a
                            slightly
                            more advanced level. I am completely fine if you decide to grade a bit differently than my
                            rubric states (although you can definitely still use it!). You can grade based on
                            functionality/design in general
                            if that works more easily for you. You'll notice I added some advanced / extra points, but
                            those were just things I thought of after the fact that do not need to be taken into
                            consideration. To put it simply,
                            I just wanted to create a 3D game with WASD/space/clicking functionality, that semeed
                            cohesive and had several new elements that I've never learned, and I think my project does
                            accomplish what I set out to achieve.

                            Feel free to send me an email if there are any issues with my code / issues with rubric /
                            anything else, I would be happy to discuss / work out any issues there are!

                        <p><strong>And lastly, I just want to say thank you for mentoring my project, especially with my
                                last-minute proposal submission. I appreciate the time it takes to read through this and grade.</strong>
                        </p>
