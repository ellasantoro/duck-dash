[X] correct WB9 Canvas Assignment submission [none]: 
[X] correct WB9G Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] (at least one) texture you made by painting (described in the readme) [none]: coin on page 09-02-01 uses my own drawing, it is described in the file.
                                                                                  donut in page 09-02-01 also uses my own drawing for the color map (not for bump map)
[X] (at least one) texture you found on the web (described in readme with proper attribution) [none]: skybox uses an image on the web, so does bump map for the donut.
                                                                                                      all images have attribution in the files that they are used in.
[X] (at least one) a texture you made by taking a picture (described in the readme) [none]: the first box with the picture frame is my own picture that I took in a museum. It is
                                                                                            fully explained in the file it is used in.
[X] identifyable as a real object [09-01-01]: painting in a frame in the Norton Simon museum
[X] texture makes it look like a real object [09-01-01]: 
[X] an appropriate scene (objects, lighting, …) [09-02-01]: 
[X] clear use of mat prop map [09-02-01]: 
[X] material map use explained [09-02-01]: included in the file - please read the comments
[X] appropriate scene (objects and lighting) [09-03-01]: 
[X] bump map object looks “bump mappy” [09-03-01]: iron block has deep ridges
[X] confirm bump map is a bump map (1 channel) [09-03-01]: 
[X] normal map object looks “normal mappy” [09-03-01]: 
[X] confirm normal map is a normal map (3 channels) [09-03-01]: 
[X] explaination of how we can see the effects [09-03-01]: see file comments
[X] both 4-1 and 4-2 look like a skybox [09-04-01]: 
[X] 4-1 is a fake sky box (get close to edge) [09-04-01]: 
[X] there is a reflective object in the scene that shows the environment map [09-05-01]: 
[X] environment map matches environment [09-05-01]: 
[X] explanation of why env map is appropriate [09-05-01]: see file comments
[X] there are shadows [09-06-01]: 
[X] there are shadows of one object onto another object [09-06-01]: 
[X] there is an object reflecting the environment (checks for code using current framework) [09-07-01]: 
[X] the reflections show the scene (not just the background) [09-07-01]: 
[X] you can see moving objects in the reflection [09-07-01]: 
[X] not the same as the example (checks for code using current framework) [09-07-01]: 
[X] combine bump/normal with color map, with explanation [09-03-01]: donut combines normal w/ color map - see file for explanation
[X] combine env map with other map types and explain [09-05-01]: combined env map w/ bump map to create glass block - see file for explanation
