Professor Wu mentioned on piazza we should submit a TXT file describing how to interact with and explaining advanced things:
My code is very heavily documented, so all advanced things can be found in the code inline. As for how to interact, if you use open my 
repository and right click index.html and open with live server (using VSCode live server extension), there are pages similar to our WBs that have
explanations of how to interact. Everything can be found on those pages.

How to interact
Space - jump, you are able to double jump around tall crate stacks to jump on top of them, the dog can't get you
        if you are on a crate of stack 2 or higher
W - move north
A - move east
S - move south
D - move west
Click - click on dog to make it go back a few steps


Let me know if you have any questions!
